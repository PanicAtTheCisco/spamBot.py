# spamBot.py v2.1
Automatic text spamming tool made to mess with some friends

# Update Notes
----------------
## Version 2.1
* Added better context for file selection
* Added invalid input checking for file selection 

# Installation
* Install the newset version of python
* Change to the directory of the downloaded folder in your terminal and use 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install dependencies.
# Usage
* To use, open the main 'spamBot.py' file and select which '.txt' file to use.
    * NOTE: Put any custom text files in the '<path to program>/spambot.py/spambot.py/Text Files' directory
* The program will then give you a 5 second window to switch to the application you wish to run it in.
* To stop the spam move mouse to the top right or left screen corners, this initiates the pyautogui failsafe and stops the program.
Otherwise, the tool will continue to run until all lines of the selected '.txt' file have been printed.
