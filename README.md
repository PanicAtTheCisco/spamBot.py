# spamBot.py
Automatic text spamming tool made to mess with some of my friends
# Installation
* Install the newset version of python
* Change to the directory of the downloaded folder in your terminal and use 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install dependencies.
# Usage
* To use, open the main 'spamBot.py' file and input the file path of a '.txt' file (your own or one of the included).
* NOTE: If the '.txt' file is in the same folder as the 'spamBot.py' file you only need to put the file name.
* The program will then give you a 5 second window to switch to the application you wish to run it in.
* To stop the spam move mouse to the top right or left screen corners, this initiates the pyautogui failsafe and stops the program.
Otherwise, the tool will continue to run until all lines of the selected '.txt' file have been printed.
